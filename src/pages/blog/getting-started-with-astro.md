# Getting Started with Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a modern static site generator that allows you to build fast, content-focused websites. In this guide, I'll walk you through the basics of getting started with Astro.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a web framework that focuses on content-rich websites. It allows you to use your favorite UI components (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) but delivers zero JavaScript by default, resulting in extremely fast websites.

## Why Choose Astro?

Here are some reasons why Astro might be the right choice for your next project:

- **Performance**: Astro websites are incredibly fast because they ship zero JavaScript by default
- **Component Islands**: Use UI framework components only where needed
- **Easy to Learn**: If you know HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, you can build with Astro
- **Flexible**: Works with React, Vue, Svelte, and more
- **Markdown Support**: Perfect for content-heavy sites like blogs

## Setting Up Your First Astro Project

Let's create a simple Astro project:

```bash
# Create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest my-astro-project

# Navigate to your new project
cd my-astro-project

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project looks like this:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

- **public/**: Static assets that don't need processing
- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components
- **src/layouts/**: Page layouts
- **src/pages/**: Each file becomes a route in your site

## Creating Your First Page

Here's a simple Astro page:

```astro
---
// This is the frontmatter section
const pageTitle = "My First Astro Page";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>{pageTitle}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Astro site!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

Astro is a powerful tool for building content-focused websites. This guide just scratches the surface of what's possible with Astro. As you get more comfortable with the basics, you can explore more advanced features like:

- Using UI framework components
